# Facial-Expression-Recognition-using-CNN
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for real-time facial expression recognition. The model can detect emotions such as angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, and surprise from live webcam input or pre-labeled images.

Description

I created this project to explore deep learning applications in computer vision. The main goal was to build a CNN that can identify emotions from facial expressions in both static images and real-time webcam streams. The model was trained on a dataset of grayscale facial images and can classify seven common emotions.

The project includes:

1. Training a CNN on labeled facial expression images

2. Real-time emotion detection using a webcam

3. Visualization of training metrics, confusion matrices, and prediction probabilities

Features

1. CNN-based model for emotion recognition

2. Real-time webcam detection with smoothing to reduce flickering predictions

3. Training and validation metrics visualization (accuracy & loss)

4. Confusion matrix for analyzing misclassifications

5. Sample predictions grid to compare true vs predicted labels

6. Emotion probability bar chart for understanding model confidence

Requirements

Python 3.8+, 
TensorFlow / Keras, 
OpenCV, 
NumPy, 
Matplotlib, 
Scikit-learn
